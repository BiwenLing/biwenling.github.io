**Welcome!**

I am currently a fourth-year joint Ph.D. candidate in Actuarial science at KU Leuven, under the supervision of Prof. [Jan Dhaene](https://jandhaene.org) and Prof. [Daniel Linders](https://daniellinders.com/). Before my doctoral studies, I obtained a Master's degree in Actuarial Science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from Nankai University. 


My research interests lie in the intersection of actuarial science and quantitative finance, including correlation trading strategies within the financial market, valuation in finance and insurance, and systematic risk management.
