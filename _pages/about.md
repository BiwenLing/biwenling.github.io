**Welcome!**

I am currently a third-year joint Ph.D. candidate in Actuarial science and Quantitative Economics at KU Leuven and the University of Amsterdam, under the supervision of Prof. [Jan Dhaene](https://jandhaene.org) and Prof. [Daniel Linders](https://daniellinders.com/). Prior to my doctoral studies, I earned a Master's degree in Actuarial Science from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from Nankai University. 


My research interests lie in the intersection of actuarial science and quantitative finance, including correlation trading strategies within the financial market, and the fair valuation of the unit-linked insurance claims.
